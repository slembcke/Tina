# ü™° Tina
Tina is a teeny tiny, header only, fiber and coroutine library!

Fibers are little lightweight user space threading primitives, sometimes called (stackful) coroutines. They are super handy! OS threads are great if you want to use multiple CPUs, but synchronizing them can be tricky and cumbersome. If you just want to run more than one bit of code at a time, fibers are much easier to use. This makes them great for lightweight uses like implementing state machines directly as code, running a script in a video game to control a cut scene, or amortizing the cost of an long algorithm over time.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Tina is simple but feature rich!
* Bring your own memory, or let Tina `malloc()` for you.
* symmetric coroutines: `init()`, `swap()`
* asymmetric coroutines: `resume()` and `yield()`
* Fast asm code supporting many common ABIs and environments:
	* x86 (32 & 64 bit): Windows, Mac, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Haiku, etc
	* ARM (32 & 64 bit): Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, microcontrollers, etc
	* RISCV (RV64GC, RV32[IFD]): Linux, microcontrollers, etc
	* More platforms (such as consoles) should be possible with #ifdef tweaks
* Supports GCC, Clang, and MSVC
* Minimal asm required to add new ABIs. 32 bit arm is only 15 instructions!
* Tiny: Currently only ~260 sloc! (Hah! Ok, it used to be, but supporting various RISCV variants tripled that. Special thanks to [HSW](https://github.com/28530367) for the 32 bit variants!)

## üîá Limitations:
* Currently no support for PowerPC, MIPS, m68k, etc.
* WASM _explicitly_ forbids multiple stacks. Workarounds such as Asyncify are problematic. :(
* Minimal built-in stack overflow protection: Bring your own memory means bring your own guard pages.

# ü¶∫ Tina Jobs
Tina Jobs is a simple fiber based job system built on top of Tina. (Loosely based on the ideas here: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022186/Parallelizing-the-Naughty-Dog-Engine)

## ‚õèÔ∏è Tina Jobs Features:
* Bring your own memory and threading
* No expensive allocations required at runtime
* Simple priority model
* Multiple queues: You control when to run them and how
	* Serial queues: Run a queue from a single thread or even poll it
	* Parallel queues: Run a single queue from many worker threads
* Queue switching allows moving a job between queues
	* Ex: Load a texture on a parallel worker thread, but submit it on a serial graphics thread
* Respectable performance: Though not a primary goal, even a Raspberry Pi can handle millions of jobs/sec!
* Minimal code footprint: At only ~300 sloc it's easy to modify or extend.

## ü™ì Limitations:
* Not designed for extreme concurrency or throughput 
	* Single lock per scheduler, doesn't implement work stealing, etc.
* Maximum job or fiber counts are set at init

# üßµ What Are Coroutines Anyway?

Functions are a simple and useful concept in structured programming. You give them some data, they process it, and return some data back to their caller. Coroutines on the other hand _yield_ instead of returning, and can be _resumed_ so they continue right where they left off.

There is a lot of confusing terminology around threading. So here's my best attempt at clarifying some of it.
* **Thread:** A thread of execution. A flow of instructions as they are executed and their state (ex: CPU registers + stack).
* **Hardware Thread:** The hardware pipeline that actually executes a thread. Usually a CPU core, but features like hyperthreading can provide multiple hardware threads per core.
* **OS Thread:** OS threads are usually what people mean when simply saying "thread". It's a thread that is scheduled and managed by the OS. Usually using CPU interrupts to switch threads automatically without requiring any code changes to support multi-tasking. (ex: Windows threads, pthreads, etc)
* **Fiber:** A lightweight thread implemented in user space code. Much simpler and faster than OS threads, but the fiber must explicitly yield to other fibers. (ex: Windows fibers, POSIX contexts, Tina coroutines)

So what's the difference between coroutines, fibers, generators, continuations, contexts, etc? Well... not much, and also a lot depending on who you talk to. Many aren't rigorously defined, so they tend to be used interchangeably. Some implementations operate at a language level by saving local variables. Some work by saving CPU registers. Some implementations have their own stack, while others work only within a single stack frame. Some implementations are asymmetric and can only yield back to the coroutine that resumed them, while others are symmetric and can switch to any other coroutine arbitrarily. Sometimes the terminology is simply a matter of what it's used for. For example generators are basically coroutines used like iterators.

Tina's coroutines (or fibers, or whatever you want to call them) each have their own stack, and they work by using ABI specific assembly code to save and restore the CPU registers. They can also be used in either a symmetric or asymmetric fashion which can be handy. There are other coroutine/fiber libraries that provide a fast assembly implementation of course, ~~but as far as I know Tina is the only one with a simple header only implementation~~ (1). I'm not always a huge fan of header only libs, but avoiding a mess of assembler files in a cross platform project is quite nice! By supporting a few of the most common ABIs, Tina should run on all of the current desktop, mobile, and console platforms available in 2021. \o/
